/*
You are given two strings, strl and str2, and a maximum number k of allowed operations. An operation can be defined as either inserting or deleting a character from either of the strings. Your task is to calculate the maximum length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) of the two strings after performing at most k operations.
Input Format
• The first line contains the string strl.
• The second line contains the string str2.
• The third line contains a single integer k, representing the maximum number of allowed operations.
Output Format
• Output a single integer representing the maximum length of the longest common subsequence after performing at most k operations.
• Print Invalid input, if k is negative.
Constraints
• strl and str2 must consist only of alphabetic characters (both uppercase and lowercase).
